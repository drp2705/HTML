Module 15) HTML in Full Stack
1. HTML Basics
Theory Assignment
Que. 1: Define HTML. What is the purpose of HTML in web development?
-->     HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and design the structure of web pages. HTML is not a programming 	language — it is a markup language that uses tags to define elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, and more.
	The main purpose of HTML is to structure and organize content on the web so that browsers (like Chrome, Edge, or Firefox) can display it properly.

Que. 2: Explain the basic structure of an HTML document. Identify the mandatory tags and their purposes.
-->
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html>
	<head>
  	<title>Page Title</title>
	</head>
	<body>
  	<h1>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
  	<p>This is an example of a basic HTML document.</p>
	</body>
	</html>


Mandatory Tags : 
 
	<!DOCTYPE html> – Defines the HTML version (HTML5).

	<html> – Root element that wraps the entire page content.

	<head> – Includes metadata and page information.

	<title> – Displays the page name in the browser tab.

	<body> – Contains visible page content.

Que. 3: What is the difference between block-level elements and inline elements in
	HTML? Provide examples of each.
-->	Block-level Elements : Block-level elements start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretching from left to right).
	They form the main structure or sections of a web page.	
	
Example: 
	<h1>This is a heading</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph under the heading.</p>
	<div>This is a block-level container.</div>

-->	Inline Elements : Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
	They are used for formatting small portions of content within a line.

Example: 
	<p>This is <b>bold text</b> and <i>italic text</i> inside a paragraph.</p>
	<a href="#">Click here</a> to visit our site.

2. HTML Forms
Theory Assignment

Que. 1: What are HTML forms used for? Describe the purpose of the input, textarea,select, and button elements.
-->	HTML forms are used to collect input or data from users on a website.
	They allow users to enter information such as names, emails, passwords, feedback, or choices — and send that data to a server for processing 
	(e.g., login, 	registration, or search).

	A form is created using the <form> tag and can include various form controls like text boxes, dropdowns, buttons, and more.


Que. 2: Explain the difference between the GET and POST methods in form submission.When should each be used?
-->	GET Method : The GET method sends form data by appending it to the URL as query parameters.

-->	POST Method : The POST method sends form data inside the request body, not visible in the URL.


	Use GET when you want to retrieve or search data and make the URL shareable.

	Use POST when you want to send or modify data securely and privately (like login or registration).
